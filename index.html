    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">Use HTTPS. It's the safest option, because content will be sent and received encrypted. Which means that the true meaning of content will be hidden in a secret code.  Keep the software of the website up to date. Take care of users IP at all costs. Make sure that the IPs are protected and managed securely. Make the developers secure the site for cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL-injections and cross-site request forgery (XSRF). Data should be sanitized by going through it manually or through third party solutions like NodeKS or ORM. Establish authorization and authentication if needed. Which can also be done manually, but mostly through an open-standard authorization protocol or framework such as OneLogin. Okta etc. Or an electronic identification such as BankID. Ensure network security.</p>
